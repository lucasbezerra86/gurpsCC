This is a character creator for the GURPS roleplaying game, 4th edition. 
Although there are other really good options out there, I had to find something exciting to practice Java coding. As a RPG GM for 27 years now,
this project seemed really interesting. 
The idea is to write on the original character sheet via PDFBox after all the calculations and filling are made. 
The application is being developed using JavaFX, so it's a standard Desktop application. A future online version might be implemented (for the sake of practice) in the future.
